**Investigated the consequences of neighborhood effects and spatial heterogeneity on LUCC model through a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA)**<br>  
*The model is implemented through vectorization computing technology, which convert scalar operations into vector operations based on the study as follow:<br>
